# Boris Bikes

### Week 1 Afternoon Task - Main Aims

* Get used to coding in Ruby
* Get using to pair programming

### Coding Scenario 

London's Boris Bikes (well, 'Santander Cycles') are awesome. Anyone can hire out a bike and ride it around London.

Let's go back several years, to the days when there were no Boris Bikes. Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, come to you with a plan: a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want you to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.

## This repo contains... Some Domain modeling (not by me)

- bb_domain_model.txt is the [Working with User Stories](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/boris_bikes/2_working_with_user_stories.md) 
challenge, /#2 on the Boris Bikes Challenge's list. It breaks the user stories down
into their constituent nouns and verbs, and presents them in an Object/Messages
table.<br/>  
- bb_domain_model.drawio is the diagram for the above challenge.<br/>
